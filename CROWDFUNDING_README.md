### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Blockchain**: Sui Move smart contracts
- **Wallet**: Sui dApp Kit integration
- **State Management**: React hooks and React Query

## Smart Contract Events

The platform emits events for tracking:
- `CampaignCreated`: When new campaigns are launched
- `Donated`: When donations are made
- `Finalized`: When campaigns are finalized
- `Withdrawn`: When funds are withdrawn
- `Refunded`: When refunds are processed

## Security Considerations

- Funds are held in escrow during active campaigns
- Only campaign owners can withdraw from successful campaigns
- Refunds require original donation receipts
- All state changes are validated by the smart contract
- Deadlines are enforced using Sui's clock system
