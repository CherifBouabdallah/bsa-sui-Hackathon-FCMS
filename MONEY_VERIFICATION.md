# Money Flow Verification Guide

## üîç How to Verify Money Goes to the Right Person

### 1. **Check Campaign Owner Address**

Before donating, always verify the campaign owner:

```typescript
// In the Campaign component, you can see:
const campaignData = await fetchCampaignData(suiClient, campaignId);
console.log("Campaign Owner:", campaignData.owner);
```

**Visual Verification in UI:**
- Campaign details page shows owner address
- Cross-reference with known creator addresses
- Look for verified social media links

### 2. **Verify Withdrawal Transactions**

When a campaign owner withdraws funds, you can track it:

```typescript
// The withdraw function in the smart contract
public entry fun withdraw(c: &mut Campaign, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    assert!(c.state == STATE_SUCCEEDED, 7);
    assert!(sender(ctx) == c.owner, 8); // ‚úÖ Only owner can withdraw!
    
    // Emits event showing where money went
    event::emit(Withdrawn { 
        campaign: object::uid_to_inner(&c.id), 
        to: c.owner,  // ‚úÖ Money goes to campaign owner
        amount: amt 
    });
}
```

### 3. **Track Money Flow on Sui Explorer**

**Step-by-step verification:**

1. **Get Campaign ID** from the dApp
2. **Visit Sui Explorer**: https://suiexplorer.com/
3. **Search for the Campaign Object**
